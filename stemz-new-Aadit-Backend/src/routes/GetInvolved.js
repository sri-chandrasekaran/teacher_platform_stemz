            <p>Contact us to inquire about us hosting an after-school program at your elementary school. 
                The after school program would consist of our in person courses, and we will provide the materials.
                High school students, please contact us about starting a STEMz Learning chapter at your school 
                to increase outreach in your area.</p>

            <h1>Donate</h1>
            <p>Our program teaches students through experimentation. Unfortunately, experiments cost money. 
                We want to keep our classes free and donations help us buy materials for our in person classes. Our 
                Venmo is @stemzlearning.</p>
